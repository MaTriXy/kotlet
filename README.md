This repo is a sample android application made by Kotlin and ***only one Java POJO file*** for the ones who love Kotlin but don't want to leave Java.
The base idea was to make a sample application using Kotlin lang with the following features:

* MVP architecture
* Dependency injection using Dagger2
* Rest calls using Okhttp + Retrofit
* RxJava2 calls

Its more about the kotlin lang itself and how to use these libraries with it. no fancy ui implemented yet but may be in future.
I will add more features soon.
